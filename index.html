      <h2>Roast Veal</h2>
      <h3>List of igridents</h3>
      <ul class="List-igridients">
        <li>
          1 whole venison leg or roast (about 3-4 lbs) — fit for a god or a mighty warrior!
        </li>
        <li>
          4 cloves of garlic, crushed — because even Odin needs to keep those pesky frost giants away
        </li>
        <li>2 tbsp juniper berries (crushed) — nature’s Norse magic spice</li>

        <li>1 tbsp dried thyme — the herb of wisdom (like Odin’s!)</li>

        <li>1 tbsp dried rosemary — as sharp as Odin’s spear, Gungnir</li>

        <li>Salt and black pepper — for the bite of a raven’s beak</li>

        <li>2 tbsp olive oil or melted butter — to keep the meat as smooth as Mimir’s well</li>

        <li>1 cup strong dark ale or mead — Odin-approved for flavor and courage</li>

        <li>2 large onions, quartered — tears of the gods, to bring out the flavor</li>

        <li>Fresh herbs for garnish — if you want to impress Freyja or just yourself</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>How to make it</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat your hearth (oven) to 350°F (175°C).
          If you were a Viking, you’d have a roaring fire and maybe a few dwarves stoking it for you.
        </li>
        <li>Rub the venison leg with salt, pepper, and the crushed garlic.
          You want it seasoned like the sagas — strong and unforgettable.</li>

        <li>Mix the crushed juniper berries, thyme, and rosemary.
          This magical herb blend is Odin’s secret weapon against bland food (and maybe Loki’s mischief).</li>

        <li>Coat the meat with olive oil or melted butter, then rub the herb mix all over.
          Imagine the Valkyries blessing this meat before it enters your belly.</li>

        <li>Place the onions in the bottom of your roasting pan, and lay the venison on top.
          Onions are like the Asgardian shield — protecting the meat’s juicy goodness.</li>

        <li>Pour the dark ale or mead over the venison.
          Because every good Viking roast needs a little liquid courage.</li>

        <li>Roast in the oven for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 135°F (57°C) for
          medium-rare.
          Like Odin’s patience waiting for Ragnarok, this is a test of timing. No rushing!
        </li>
        <li>Let the meat rest for 15 minutes before slicing.
          Even Odin knows the value of patience — and letting the juices settle.</li>
      </ol>
